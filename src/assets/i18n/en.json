  "OUR-STORY": {
    "TITLE": "OUR STORY",
    "ENCOUNTER": "A loooong long time ago -seven years to be precise- Jean-Yves, a smart and responsible aerospace engineering student, decided Glasgow would be the perfect destination for his Erasmus year. A few days after his arrival, he went on a trip to Edinburgh, the Scottish capital. There, among bagpipes, whisky and haggis, there was a group of Spanish ladies. Little did he know that he would end up proposing to one of them seven years later!",
    "BEGINNING": "María and Jean-Yves (aka Chantal) spent some time together over the following weeks and got to know each other. They started dating after a frightening Halloween soirée and J-Y declared his love under the beautiful Ferris Wheel in Liverpool, during a nice -and cold!- trip to the city of the Beatles.",
    "ERASMUS": "They had a great Erasmus year together... But, unfortunately, after a few amazing but short months, Jean-Yves had to go back to Toulouse and do his internship, and María had to finish her undergraduate studies in Vigo. It was quite scary at the beginning, but it also meant they both got to travel very often over the following few -not so few!- years.",
    "NICE": "Jean-Yves soon moved to Nice, and María visited him as often as she could.",
    "INTERPRETER": "She had decided she wanted to become a conference interpreter. But that meant spending one more year away from J-Y! She moved to Edinburgh to do her master's and, only a few months later, J-Y started working in London.",
    "BARNES": "When she finished her studies, she finally moved into J-Y's tiny flat in Barnes, west London  (\"only\" four years after they started dating!).",
    "HAPPY": "They lived happily ever after, discovering every hidden place in London and travelling together...",
    "CONCLUSION": "And several years later... ",
    "PROPOSED": "he proposed!"
  },

  "PROPOSAL": {
    "TITLE": "THE PROPOSAL",
    "DEPARTURE": "After a long busy week at work, Jean-Yves called María on a Friday evening to let her know he was leaving work, as he usually does. Only this time he said: \"You need to pack your suitcase. We are leaving in one hour and spending the weekend away.\"",
    "PACKING": "María was taken aback. She had no idea what to pack into her suitcase. Summer clothes? Winter clothes? Elegant or casual outfits? She decided to bring a bit of everything. After all, they were only going to be away for a couple of days, as she had an important interpreting job on Monday that she couldn't miss.",
    "CARDIFF": "J-Y arrived by car an hour and a half later. They were going to Wales! They spent the first evening in Cardiff and then started a roadtrip around the Welsh countryside. The weather was awful but the landscapes were lovely!",
    "ROAD-TRIP": "On Saturday night they slept in a cosy bed and breakfast in the heart of Snowdonia. The following morning María was so sad that their little weekend break was coming to an end... They still had a day to go though! They visited Snowdonia and Caernarfon and had lunch in Conwy.",
    "CONWY": "While they were eating lunch, J-Y suggested adding an extra stop to their itinerary before going back to London, as they had plenty of time to spare. He said he was sure María would love that last stop, so she felt a bit intrigued and checked the maps on her phone.\"Oh my God!\", she said, \"We are just an hour away from Liverpool! Are we going to Liverpool?\"",
    "ROAD-TO-LIVERPOOL": "And they went to Liverpool indeed. It was one of María's favourite places, as it was the city of the Beatles and she had been there previously, visiting the Cavern and seeing a Paul McCartney concert. It was also a very special place for both of them, as they had been there together at the very beginning of their relationship.",
    "LIVERPOOL": "They visited Mathew Street, where the John Lennon statue and the Cavern are, and then headed back to Albert Dock, where the car was parked. Jean-Yves suggested a ride on the ferris wheel, to remember their first time in Liverpool. It was very windy, but the wheel was working. Although it all looked like an improvised plan, it turned out J-Y had booked the wheel's luxury cabin, with champagne and chocolates!",
    "FERRIS": "I think you can guess the end (or should we say the beginning?) of this story. When they were on the ferris wheel, Jean-Yves bent the knee (just like Jon Snow!) and.... spoiler alert: María said YES!!!",
    "NIGHT": "But that wasn't all: Jean-Yves had more surprises in store for María and the day was not over! He had booked the Paul McCartney suite at the Hard Day's Night Hotel, and a table at the amazing Panoramic 34 restaurant! In the end, María found out she didn't really have an interpreting job the following day... J-Y had thought of every single detail!",
    "CONCLUSION": "So... this is how this all started! It was a very exciting weekend and we're happy we'll soon have the chance to share one of the most important days of our lives with you all!"
